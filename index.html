    <h2>by Mohamed Lugey</h2>
    <h3>Privacy Policy for HomeFind</h3>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> March 30, 2017</p>

    <p>By installing the mobile application linked to this Privacy Policy (the “Privacy Policy” and “Affiliated Application”), you hereby consent to and agree to adhere to the stipulations outlined herein, alongside any other operating rules, policies, and supplementary terms or documents that may be periodically published by AppsGeyser. It is imperative that you review this Privacy Policy with utmost care.</p>

    <h2>General</h2>

    <p>The Affiliated Application employs one or multiple services provided by AppsGeyser. It is crucial to note that while AppsGeyser does not serve as the publisher of the Affiliated Application, it does furnish mobile analytics and intelligence services by collecting specific information regarding your interaction with the Affiliated Application and/or other apps installed on your device. This data collection aims to empower the Affiliated Application and other AppsGeyser partners in delivering advertisements, products, and services that are not only relevant but also meaningful to users (collectively referred to as the “Services”).</p>

    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

    <p>This Privacy Policy delineates the privacy practices associated with the AppsGeyser Service, encapsulating our handling of personal information collected upon your installation of a mobile application utilizing our Services. Please be aware that we bear no responsibility for, nor do we exert control over, the privacy practices of any mobile application (including the Affiliated Application), nor do we govern how the developers of mobile applications gather, utilize, or disseminate information pertaining to you. For insights into how a mobile application manages your information, please consult the relevant application’s privacy policy.</p>

    <h2>Information You Provide</h2>

    <h3>Account Information</h3>
    <p>When you create an account, you must register a phone number. This phone number facilitates our Services not only for you but also for other users. Optionally, you may append additional details to your account, such as a profile name and picture, all of which are safeguarded by end-to-end encryption.</p>

    <h3>Messages</h3>
    <p>Rest assured, we cannot decrypt or access the content of your messages or calls. The app queues end-to-end encrypted messages on its servers for devices that may be temporarily offline (for instance, if a phone's battery depletes). Your message history is retained solely on your devices.</p>

    <h3>Contacts</h3>
    <p>Our app may, with your permission, uncover which contacts in your address book are also Signal users, employing a service meticulously designed to protect your contacts' privacy. Information from your device's contacts may be cryptographically hashed and sent to the server to identify registered contacts.</p>

    <h3>User Support</h3>
    <p>Should you reach out to User Support, any personal data shared will be retained exclusively for the purpose of investigating the issue and corresponding with you regarding your case.</p>

    <h3>Managing Your Information</h3>
    <p>In the app's settings, you hold the power to manage your personal information. Whether it be updating your profile or enabling additional privacy features such as a Registration Lock PIN, the choice is yours.</p>

    <h2>Information We May Share</h2>

    <p>We collaborate with third parties to deliver certain Services. For instance, our Third-Party Providers send a verification code to your phone number during registration. These providers are bound by their Privacy Policies to ensure the safeguarding of your information. Furthermore, there may be instances wherein the app is obliged to share your data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To comply with applicable laws, regulations, legal processes, or governmental requests.</li>
        <li>To enforce relevant Terms, including investigations of potential violations.</li>
        <li>To detect, prevent, or address fraud, security, or technical issues.</li>
        <li>To protect against harm to the rights, property, or safety of us, our users, or the public as permitted by law.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Upon installing an Affiliated Application using our Service, we may automatically gather specific information from your Android device, including but not limited to device make and model, browser type and version, IP address, MAC address, operating system details, locale information, and a roster of installed applications. You may also grant permission for the mobile application to collect certain types of information, which is typically governed by your mobile operating system's consent process.</p>

    <h2>Information from Third-Party Social Media Services</h2>

    <p>The application allows you to create an account and log in through various Third-party Social Media Services such as Google, Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn. Should you choose to register through these services, we may collect personal data associated with your account, thereby granting us permission to use, share, and store this information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
